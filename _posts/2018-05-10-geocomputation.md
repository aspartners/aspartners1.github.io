Here's some basic text.

And here's some *italics*

Here some **bold** text.

What about a [link](https://github.com/andresalerno)?

Here's a bullet list:

- Third item

Here's a numbered list:

1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
```python
    import numpy as np

    def test_function(x,y):
      z = np.sum(x,y)
        return z
```

R code block:
```r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("some.file.csv")
head(df)
```

Here's some inline code `x+y`.

Here's an image:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/home_page.jpg" alt="put descrpition here">

Here's another image using kramdown:
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/home_page.jpg)

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
